## Landscape

Coinbase is categorized in the cryptocurrency and blockchain domain. These are list of various major trends and innovation of this domain over 5- 10 years;

1. Resurging and Expanding use cases for NFTs: The pending resurgence of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) is another trend that crypto experts say they see on the horizon. In addition, a report from Verified Market Research predicts the NFT market will reach $231 billion by 2030.

2. Increasing regulation of cryptocurrency and exchanges: In the wake of the FTX implosion, regulatory scrutiny of the crypto market is at an all-time high. So far, the US government has very few laws and regulations surrounding cryptocurrency. In 2022, President Biden released an executive order and a proposed framework for regulating cryptocurrency. Much of the solution is aimed at stopping criminal activity in the crypto industry, which is much-needed considering there’s been more than $1 billion lost via cryptocurrency scams since 2021.

3. Crypto’s growing climate impact: A lesser-known but potentially pressing trend for the crypto industry is the sector’s energy and climate change implications. According to a White House news release, the production of crypto assets uses between 120 and 240 billion kW hours of electricity per year—more than the total annual electricity usage of Argentina or Australia. In 2022, Ethereum launched The Merge, a software upgrade that drastically cut energy use by crypto miners by getting rid of proof of work and replacing it with proof of stake, a verification method that utilizes cryptocurrency holdings.

Major companies in cryptocurrency domain are River Financial,Robinhood Binance, Bittrex, Bitfinex, Kraken, Paxos, Xapo, Bithumb, BitMart and Bibox.

Societies with great economic freedom have higher life expectancy and GDP growth, less war and corruption, better treatment of the environment, and higher income of the poorest 10% of people in society. Coinbase purpose is to help make this future reality. Coinbase is democratizing access to the crypto economy by enabling anyone with an internet connection to invest in and use crypto assets easily and securely. Customers that start with us grow with us as they experience the benefits of the open financial system by using crypto-based products for staking, spending, saving, and borrowing.

Today, we enable customers around the world to store their savings in a wide range of crypto assets, including Bitcoin and USD Coin, and to instantly transfer value globally with the tap of a finger on a smartphone. We provide companies with new ways to transact, incentivize, and reward their users, from offering compounding rewards on savings that pay out by the second to compensating users for virtually completing tasks through global micropayments. In addition, some of business impact of this company are expanding the depth and breadth of assets by expanding investment in infrastructure and regulatory clarity to help pave the path for new assets to be represented as crypto assets, adding more customers, and launching innovative products for customers to engage with crypto and also providing technology to help our ecosystem partners better connect and transact with customers.

In addition to our financial results, we use the following business metrics to evaluate our business, measure our performance, identify trends affecting our business, and make strategic decisions:

1. Verified Users
We define Verified Users as all retail users, institutions, and ecosystem partners that have registered an account on our platform and confirmed either their email address or phone number, or that have established an account with a username on our non-custodial wallet application, as of the date of measurement. Verified Users are an indication of our scale and represent a potential revenue opportunity for us. These customers have demonstrated an interest in our platform or direct intent to transact with crypto assets. Verified Users represent the top level of our customer acquisition funnel. We believe we have an opportunity to engage Verified Users and convert them to MTUs by marketing our growing suite of products and services. Verified Users may overstate the number of unique customers who have registered an account on our platform as one customer may register for, and use, multiple accounts with different email addresses, phone numbers, or usernames.

2. Monthly Transacting Users (MTU)
We define a Monthly Transacting User, or MTU, as a retail user who actively or passively transacts in one or more products on our platform at least once during the rolling 28-day period ending on the date of measurement. MTUs presented for the end of a quarter are the average of each month’s MTUs in each respective quarter. MTUs represent our transacting base of retail users who drive potential revenue generating transactions on our platform. Revenue generating transactions include active transactions,
such as buying or selling crypto assets through our Invest product and spending on the Coinbase Card, or passive transactions such as earning a staking or savings reward. MTUs also engage in transactions that are non-revenue generating such as Send and Receive. MTUs engage in transactions that drive both transaction revenue and subscription and services revenue.

3. Assets on Platform
We define Assets on Platform as the total U.S. dollar equivalent value of both fiat currency and crypto assets held or managed in digital wallets on our platform, including our custody services, calculated based on the market price on the date of measurement. Assets on Platform demonstrates the scale of balances held across our suite of products and services, the trust customers place in us to securely store their assets, and the underlying growth of the crypto economy. Assets on Platform also represent our monetization opportunity for subscription products and services, including current products such as Store, Stake, Save, Borrow, and Lend. Assets on Platform generate fees that are recorded as subscription and services revenue when customers engage with these products.

4. Trading Volume
We define Trading Volume as the total U.S. dollar equivalent value of matched trades transacted between a buyer and seller through our platform during the period of measurement. Trading Volume represents the product of the quantity of asset transacted and the trade price at the time the transaction was executed. As trading activity directly impacts transaction revenue, we believe this measure is a reflection of liquidity on our order books, trading health, and the underlying growth of the crypto economy. Trading Volume on our platform is influenced by the price of Bitcoin and Crypto Asset Volatility. In periods of high Bitcoin price and/or Crypto Asset Volatility, we have experienced correspondingly high levels of Trading Volume on our platform.

Coinbase is performing well relative to the companies in the same domain as it continue to enhance technical infrastructure and other technology offerings to remain competitive and maintain a platform that has the required functionality, performance, capacity, security, and speed to attract and retain customers, including large, institutional, high-frequency and high-volume traders. As a result, we expect to expend significant costs and expenses to develop and upgrade our technical infrastructure to meet the evolving needs of the industry.
